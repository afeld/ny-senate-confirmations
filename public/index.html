      content="Reinvent Albany obtained New York State Senate confirmation vote records through the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) and is publishing them here to make this critical information accessible to the public. These votes determine whether nominees to powerful state boards, commissions, and agencies are approved, yet the Senate does not routinely post detailed records online. By making this data available, we aim to shine a light on how senators vote on key appointments and to strengthen transparency and accountability in New York State government."
